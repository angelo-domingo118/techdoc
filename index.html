          Python, a high-level programming language, is known for its clear
          syntax and code readability. Its vast libraries and frameworks make it
          a versatile language, suitable for various types of projects including
          web development, data analysis, machine learning, artificial
          intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting started with Python is straightforward. It requires the
          installation of the Python interpreter, available for download from
          the official website. Once installed, Python files (.py) can be
          executed from the command line using the command
          <code>python filename.py</code>, where "filename.py" is the name of
          the Python file.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a simple Python program:</p>
        <code> print("Hello, World!") </code>
        <p>
          When executed, this program will output: <code>Hello, World!</code>
        </p>

        <p>
          Python also provides an interactive interpreter, allowing developers
          to execute Python commands directly in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
          environment, fostering a quicker iterative development process.
        </p>

      <section id="Variables_and_Operators" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables and Operators</header>
        <p>
          Variables in Python are used to store data that can be used and
          manipulated throughout a program. They can hold different types of
          data like numbers, strings, lists, etc. Variables are created the
          moment a value is assigned to them. In Python, variables don't need a
          declaration, which makes it easier to work with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Operators, on the other hand, are symbols that are used to perform
          operations on operands. Python has various operators; these include
          arithmetic operators like +, -, *, / for addition, subtraction,
          multiplication, and division respectively; comparison operators like
          ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= for equality, inequality, less than, greater
          than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to
          respectively; and logical operators like and, or, not for logical
          operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is an example demonstrating the use of variables and operators in
          Python:
        </p>
        <code>
          x = 10 y = 20 sum = x + y # Addition <br />
          difference = x - y # Subtraction <br />
          product = x * y # Multiplication <br />
          quotient = x / y # Division
        </code>
        <p>
          The above code snippet demonstrates simple arithmetic operations using
          variables and operators in Python.

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          Python supports a variety of data types, which are categories of data
          that can be used in various ways. The fundamental data types in Python
          include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Besides, Python
          provides composite data types like lists, tuples, sets, and
          dictionaries which allow you to store collections of items.
        </p>

        <p>Here is a brief overview of these data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Integers:</strong> These are whole numbers without a decimal
            point, e.g., -10, 0, 100.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Floats:</strong> These are numbers that have a decimal
            point, e.g., -10.1, 0.0, 100.5.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strings:</strong> These are sequences of characters enclosed
            in single, double, or triple quotes, e.g., 'hello', "world",
            '''Python'''.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Booleans:</strong> These are true or false values, often
            used to control the flow of a program with conditional statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lists:</strong> These are ordered collections of items,
            which can be of any type, and are mutable, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a',
            'b', 'c'].
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tuples:</strong> These are like lists, but are immutable,
            e.g., (1, 2, 3).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sets:</strong> These are unordered collections of unique
            items, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dictionaries:</strong> These are unordered collections of
            key-value pairs, e.g., {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Understanding these data types and how to work with them is
          foundational to programming in Python. They provide the building
          blocks upon which more complex operations and data structures can be
          built.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Control_Flow" class="main-section">
        <header>Control Flow</header>
        <p>
          Control flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows
          developers to dictate the order in which operations are performed in a
          program. In Python, control flow is managed through the use of
          conditional statements and loops.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conditional statements in Python include <code>if</code>,
          <code>elif</code> (else if), and <code>else</code>. These statements
          allow developers to execute certain blocks of code based on whether
          specified conditions are true or false. Here's a simple example:
        </p>
        <code>
          age = 18 if age >= 18: print("You are an adult.") else: print("You are
          a minor.")
        </code>
        <p>
          In this code snippet, the <code>print</code> statement to execute
          depends on the value of the <code>age</code> variable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looping statements in Python include <code>for</code> and
          <code>while</code> loops. These loops allow developers to execute a
          block of code repeatedly, as long as a specified condition is met. For
          instance:
        </p>
        <code> for i in range(5): print(i) </code>
        <p>
          This <code>for</code> loop will print the numbers 0 through 4 to the
          console, demonstrating a simple loop in action.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>
          Functions in Python are used to encapsulate a group of statements that
          can perform a specific task. Functions can accept input values, known
          as parameters, and return output values. They provide a way to
          structure code in a modular fashion, allowing for code reuse and
          better organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          A function in Python is defined using the <code>def</code> keyword,
          followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses, and a colon. The
          statements that the function executes are indented under the function
          definition. Here's a simple example of a function definition and call
          in Python:
        </p>
        <code> def greet(name): print(f"Hello, {name}!") greet("Alice") </code>
        <p>
          In this example, a function named <code>greet</code> is defined, which
          takes one parameter called <code>name</code>. The function prints a
          greeting message using the provided name. The function is then called
          with the argument <code>"Alice"</code>, which prints
          <code>Hello, Alice!</code> to the console.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functions can also return values to the caller using the
          <code>return</code> keyword. When a return statement is executed, the
          function terminates, and the value specified in the return statement
          is passed back to the caller. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <code> def add(a, b): return a + b sum = add(5, 3) </code>
        <p>
          In this example, a function named <code>add</code> is defined, which
          takes two parameters, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. The function
          returns the sum of these two values. The function is then called with
          the arguments <code>5</code> and <code>3</code>, and the returned
          value, <code>8</code>, is assigned to the variable <code>sum</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Functions in Python can have default parameter values, variable-length
          arguments, and keyword-only arguments, among other features, making
          them a flexible and powerful mechanism for structuring and organizing
          code.
